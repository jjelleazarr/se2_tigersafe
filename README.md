### Where to start coding

All dart files are provided on the /lib folder. 

For the front-end, /views folder will be utilized. 

For the back-end, /controllers, /models, /services, and /utilities will be utilized.

- /models -> Dart classes to represent the data. 
- /views -> UI widgets go here.
- /controllers -> Refer to pseudocode in SDD.
- /services -> Firebase database access go here and other external interactions.
- /utilities -> For helper functions, constants, or extensions.

This project is cross-platform capable. No need to separate files for each user.

Use conditional statements for determining the user in each dart files.
