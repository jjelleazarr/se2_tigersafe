ðŸ”´ How to Perform CPR

1. **Ensure Scene Safety**  
   Make sure the environment is safe for both you and the victim.

2. **Check Responsiveness and Breathing**  
   Tap the person and shout. If there's no response and they're not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR.

3. **Call Emergency Services (911 or local number)**  
   If possible, ask a bystander to call while you begin chest compressions.

4. **Begin Chest Compressions**
   - Place hands center of chest, one on top of the other.
   - Push hard and fast, 2 inches deep at 100â€“120 compressions per minute.
   - Let the chest fully recoil between compressions.

5. **Give Rescue Breaths (if trained)**
   - After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.
   - Tilt the head back, lift chin, pinch nose, and give a breath lasting 1 second.

6. **Continue Until Help Arrives**
   - Keep going with compressions and breaths.
   - Use an AED if available.
